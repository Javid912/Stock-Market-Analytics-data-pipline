# Data Visualization Guide

## Introduction to Business Intelligence

Business Intelligence (BI) is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive business decisions. This guide will help you understand BI basics and best practices for data visualization.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Types of Analytics
- **Descriptive Analytics**: What happened?
- **Diagnostic Analytics**: Why did it happen?
- **Predictive Analytics**: What might happen?
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: What should we do?

### 2. Data Visualization Types
1. **Time Series**
   - Line charts for trends
   - Bar charts for periodic comparisons
   - Area charts for cumulative trends

2. **Comparisons**
   - Bar charts for category comparisons
   - Pie charts for part-to-whole relationships
   - Scatter plots for correlations

3. **Distributions**
   - Histograms for data distribution
   - Box plots for statistical summaries
   - Heat maps for density visualization

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Keep visualizations simple and focused
- **Context**: Provide necessary context through labels and titles
- **Consistency**: Use consistent colors and formats
- **Accessibility**: Ensure readability for all users

### 2. Chart Selection Guidelines
- Use line charts for continuous data over time
- Use bar charts for categorical comparisons
- Use scatter plots for relationship analysis
- Use pie charts sparingly and only for parts of a whole

### 3. Color Usage
- Use consistent color schemes
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Consider color-blind friendly palettes
- Use color to highlight important data

## Metabase Specific Guide

### 1. Getting Started
1. Access Metabase at http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with default credentials
3. Connect to your database
4. Create your first dashboard

### 2. Creating Visualizations
1. **Basic Charts**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Daily Stock Prices
   SELECT 
       trading_date,
       symbol,
       close_price
   FROM public_marts.fact_market_metrics
   ORDER BY trading_date DESC
   ```

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Moving Averages
   SELECT 
       trading_date,
       symbol,
       close_price,
       AVG(close_price) OVER 
           (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY trading_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as ma_20
   FROM public_marts.fact_market_metrics
   ```

### 3. Dashboard Organization
- Group related visualizations
- Use clear titles and descriptions
- Add filters for interactivity
- Include date ranges where applicable

## Market Data Visualization

### 1. Common Financial Charts
- Candlestick charts for price action
- Volume bars for trading activity
- Technical indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD)

### 2. Key Metrics to Monitor
- Daily price changes
- Trading volume
- Market capitalization
- Sector performance

### 3. Example Queries
```sql
-- Daily Price Changes
SELECT 
    trading_date,
    symbol,
    close_price,
    (close_price - LAG(close_price) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY trading_date))
        / LAG(close_price) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY trading_date) * 100 as daily_return
FROM public_marts.fact_market_metrics
ORDER BY trading_date DESC;

-- Volume Analysis
SELECT 
    trading_date,
    symbol,
    volume,
    AVG(volume) OVER 
        (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY trading_date 
         ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as avg_volume_20d
FROM public_marts.fact_market_metrics
ORDER BY trading_date DESC;
```

## Best Practices for Financial Dashboards

### 1. Organization
- Group metrics by category
- Provide both overview and detailed views
- Include relevant time periods
- Add comparative benchmarks

### 2. Essential Components
- Market overview
- Company-specific metrics
- Technical indicators
- Volume analysis
- Performance comparisons

### 3. Interactivity
- Date range selectors
- Symbol filters
- Drill-down capabilities
- Custom metric calculations

## Maintenance and Updates

### 1. Regular Tasks
- Review dashboard performance
- Update visualizations as needed
- Archive unused charts
- Monitor data freshness

### 2. Quality Checks
- Verify data accuracy
- Check calculation correctness
- Ensure proper filtering
- Test dashboard loading times
