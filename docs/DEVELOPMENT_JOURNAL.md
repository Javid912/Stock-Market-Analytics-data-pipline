# DataPipe Analytics Development Journal

## Project Overview
Building a production-grade ETL pipeline for processing financial market data using Apache Airflow, dbt, and PostgreSQL.

## Development Log

### Day 1: Project Setup and Initial Structure

#### 1. Project Structure Setup
Created the initial project structure with all necessary directories:
```
datapipe_analytics/
├── .github/workflows/      # CI/CD workflows
├── airflow/                # Airflow DAGs and plugins
├── dbt/                    # dbt transformations
├── src/                    # Source code
├── tests/                  # Test files
└── docker/                 # Dockerfile definitions
```

#### 2. Docker Environment Setup
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with multiple services:
  * PostgreSQL for data warehouse
  * Airflow (split into init, webserver, and scheduler)
  * dbt for transformations
  * Test service for running tests
- Key Learning: Splitting Airflow into multiple services (init, webserver, scheduler) improves maintainability and follows best practices

#### 3. Configuration Management
- Created `.env.example` for environment variables
- Implemented configuration for:
  * Database credentials
  * Airflow settings
  * Alpha Vantage API key
  * dbt settings
- Key Learning: Using environment variables for configuration allows for easy deployment across different environments

### Day 2: Data Extraction Layer

#### 1. Alpha Vantage Client Implementation
- Created robust API client with:
  * Rate limiting (5 requests/minute)
  * Error handling with custom exceptions
  * Input validation
  * Comprehensive logging
  * Multiple endpoints support (daily prices, intraday, company overview)
- Key Learning: Implementing rate limiting is crucial for API clients to avoid hitting limits

#### 2. Testing Setup
- Implemented comprehensive test suite:
  * Unit tests for validation
  * Integration tests for API calls
  * Fixture usage for test client
  * Environment variable handling in tests
- Key Learning: Using pytest fixtures makes tests more maintainable and reduces code duplication

#### 3. Python Package Structure
- Created proper Python package structure:
  * Added `__init__.py` files
  * Set up `PYTHONPATH` in both local and Docker environments
  * Created `pytest.ini` for test configuration
- Key Learning: Proper package structure is essential for imports to work in both local and Docker environments

### Technical Decisions and Their Rationale

#### 1. Docker Setup
- **Decision**: Split Airflow into multiple services
- **Rationale**: 
  * Better separation of concerns
  * Easier scaling and maintenance
  * Follows Airflow best practices
  * Allows independent scaling of webserver and scheduler

#### 2. Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Created separate test Docker container
- **Rationale**:
  * Ensures consistent test environment
  * Isolates test dependencies
  * Makes CI/CD integration easier

#### 3. API Client Design
- **Decision**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
- **Rationale**:
  * Prevents API quota exhaustion
  * Makes debugging easier
  * Provides clear error messages
  * Follows Python best practices

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Python Import Issues
**Problem**: Tests couldn't find the `src` module
**Solutions**:
1. Added empty `__init__.py` files
2. Created `pytest.ini` with `pythonpath = .`
3. Set `PYTHONPATH` in Docker environment

#### 2. Docker Networking
**Problem**: Services couldn't communicate
**Solution**: Created a dedicated Docker network and added proper service dependencies

#### 3. Environment Variables
**Problem**: Configuration management across services
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive `.env.example`
- Used environment file in docker-compose
- Added proper variable substitution

### Next Steps

1. Data Loading Layer:
- Create PostgreSQL schema
- Design staging tables
- Implement incremental loading logic

2. Data Transformation:
- Set up dbt models
- Create staging views
- Implement business logic

3. Pipeline Orchestration:
- Enhance Airflow DAGs
- Add proper scheduling
- Implement error handling

### Best Practices Learned

1. Docker:
- Use multi-stage builds when possible
- Keep images minimal
- Use proper health checks
- Implement proper networking

2. Python:
- Use virtual environments
- Implement proper package structure
- Add comprehensive logging
- Use type hints

3. Testing:
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Separate unit and integration tests
- Mock external services when appropriate
- Test both success and error cases
