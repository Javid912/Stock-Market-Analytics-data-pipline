## Project Overview
Building a production-grade ETL pipeline for processing financial market data using Apache Airflow, dbt, and PostgreSQL.

## Development Log

### Day 1: Project Setup and Initial Structure

#### 1. Project Structure Setup
Created the initial project structure with all necessary directories:
```
datapipe_analytics/
├── .github/workflows/      # CI/CD workflows
├── airflow/                # Airflow DAGs and plugins
├── dbt/                    # dbt transformations
├── src/                    # Source code
├── tests/                  # Test files
└── docker/                 # Dockerfile definitions
```

#### 2. Docker Environment Setup
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with multiple services:
  * PostgreSQL for data warehouse
  * Airflow (split into init, webserver, and scheduler)
  * dbt for transformations
  * Test service for running tests
- Key Learning: Splitting Airflow into multiple services (init, webserver, scheduler) improves maintainability and follows best practices

#### 3. Configuration Management
- Created `.env.example` for environment variables
- Implemented configuration for:
  * Database credentials
  * Airflow settings
  * Alpha Vantage API key
  * dbt settings
- Key Learning: Using environment variables for configuration allows for easy deployment across different environments

### Day 2: Data Extraction Layer

#### 1. Alpha Vantage Client Implementation
- Created robust API client with:
  * Rate limiting (5 requests/minute)
  * Error handling with custom exceptions
  * Input validation
  * Comprehensive logging
  * Multiple endpoints support (daily prices, intraday, company overview)
- Key Learning: Implementing rate limiting is crucial for API clients to avoid hitting limits

#### 2. Testing Setup
- Implemented comprehensive test suite:
  * Unit tests for validation
  * Integration tests for API calls
  * Fixture usage for test client
  * Environment variable handling in tests
- Key Learning: Using pytest fixtures makes tests more maintainable and reduces code duplication

#### 3. Python Package Structure
- Created proper Python package structure:
  * Added `__init__.py` files
  * Set up `PYTHONPATH` in both local and Docker environments
  * Created `pytest.ini` for test configuration
- Key Learning: Proper package structure is essential for imports to work in both local and Docker environments

### Technical Decisions and Their Rationale

#### 1. Docker Setup
- **Decision**: Split Airflow into multiple services
- **Rationale**: 
  * Better separation of concerns
  * Easier scaling and maintenance
  * Follows Airflow best practices
  * Allows independent scaling of webserver and scheduler

#### 2. Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Created separate test Docker container
- **Rationale**:
  * Ensures consistent test environment
  * Isolates test dependencies
  * Makes CI/CD integration easier

#### 3. API Client Design
- **Decision**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
- **Rationale**:
  * Prevents API quota exhaustion
  * Makes debugging easier
  * Provides clear error messages
  * Follows Python best practices

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Python Import Issues
**Problem**: Tests couldn't find the `src` module
**Solutions**:
1. Added empty `__init__.py` files
2. Created `pytest.ini` with `pythonpath = .`
3. Set `PYTHONPATH` in Docker environment

#### 2. Docker Networking
**Problem**: Services couldn't communicate
**Solution**: Created a dedicated Docker network and added proper service dependencies

#### 3. Environment Variables
**Problem**: Configuration management across services
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive `.env.example`
- Used environment file in docker-compose
- Added proper variable substitution

### Next Steps

1. Data Loading Layer:
- Create PostgreSQL schema
- Design staging tables
- Implement incremental loading logic

2. Data Transformation:
- Set up dbt models
- Create staging views
- Implement business logic

3. Pipeline Orchestration:
- Enhance Airflow DAGs
- Add proper scheduling
- Implement error handling

### Best Practices Learned

1. Docker:
- Use multi-stage builds when possible
- Keep images minimal
- Use proper health checks
- Implement proper networking

2. Python:
- Use virtual environments
- Implement proper package structure
- Add comprehensive logging
- Use type hints

3. Testing:
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Separate unit and integration tests
- Mock external services when appropriate
- Test both success and error cases 

### Day 8: Container Optimization for Resource Efficiency (March 16, 2024)

#### 1. Container Weight Challenges
- Identified performance issues with Docker containers on older hardware
- Containers consuming excessive resources, causing system slowdowns
- Need for lighter, more efficient container configurations
- Researched best practices for container optimization

#### 2. Optimization Strategies Implemented
- **Alpine-based Images**: Switched to Alpine Linux-based images where possible
  * Reduced image size by 5-10x
  * Decreased memory footprint
  * Faster container startup times
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Implemented for Python services
  * Separated build dependencies from runtime
  * Eliminated unnecessary build tools from final images
  * Reduced final image size by 50-70%
- **Custom PostgreSQL Configuration**: Optimized for container environment
  * Reduced shared buffer size
  * Limited connection count
  * Configured for lower memory usage

#### 3. Service-Specific Optimizations
- **PostgreSQL**:
  * Switched to postgres:13-alpine
  * Custom runtime configuration for memory efficiency
  * Reduced resource limits in docker-compose
- **dbt**:
  * Implemented multi-stage build
  * Optimized Python dependencies
  * Reduced final image size
- **Airflow**:
  * Maintained Airflow functionality while optimizing configuration
  * Reduced worker count and parallelism
  * Optimized scheduler settings

#### 4. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive container best practices guide
- Documented optimization strategies and implementation details
- Added monitoring recommendations for container performance
- Updated README with information about optimized configurations

#### 5. Key Learnings
1. **Container Efficiency**:
   - Base image selection has dramatic impact on resource usage
   - Multi-stage builds are essential for Python services
   - Custom configuration can significantly reduce resource needs

2. **Performance Tradeoffs**:
   - Some optimizations may impact development convenience
   - Alpine images require additional configuration for some dependencies
   - Important to balance size reduction with functionality

3. **Monitoring Importance**:
   - Regular monitoring of container resource usage is essential
   - Different services have different optimization opportunities
   - Continuous improvement approach yields best results

#### 6. Future Optimization Opportunities
- Further dependency auditing and reduction
- Explore distroless containers for production
- Implement more granular resource limits
- Add automated container size monitoring
