## Day 7: Environment Troubleshooting and Dashboard Development

### Environment and Dependencies Resolution
- **Issue**: Encountered segmentation faults when running the Streamlit dashboard due to Python version and package compatibility issues
- **Resolution**:
  - Migrated from Python 3.8 to Python 3.9
  - Implemented specific version constraints for key dependencies:
    - streamlit==1.24.1
    - pandas==1.5.3
    - plotly==5.18.0
    - psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
  - Successfully resolved segmentation faults and got the dashboard running

### Current Challenges
- **Database Connectivity**: Dashboard is unable to connect to PostgreSQL database
  - Error: "could not translate host name 'postgres' to address"
  - Root cause: Docker container networking issue - dashboard running on host machine cannot resolve Docker container hostname
  - Next steps: Update database connection configuration to use localhost or Docker network bridge

### Technical Learnings
1. **Python Environment Management**:
   - Importance of maintaining consistent Python versions across development
   - Critical role of package version compatibility in preventing runtime issues
   - Value of explicit version pinning for core dependencies

2. **Docker Networking**:
   - Need to consider network connectivity between host machine and containerized services
   - Importance of proper host resolution when accessing containerized databases

### Next Steps
1. Resolve database connectivity by updating connection configuration
2. Implement proper error handling in dashboard for database connection issues
3. Add connection retry logic with appropriate timeout settings
